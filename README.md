# ReaperAudicaTools
These are python scripts to help author Audica maps with REAPER

All these tools require python 3, and python must be actived in REAPER's Reascript settings.

# audica_maker.py
This will make an audica file. This is currently a bit buggy, you might have to retry to make the audica file with render disabled after the first try.

# cues_export.py
This script will ask you which difficulty to export and then will write a cues file ready for Audica or NotReaper. Supports all 4 difficulties and the "community" difficulty.

# cues_import.py
This script will ask you which difficulty you want to import a cues file into.
